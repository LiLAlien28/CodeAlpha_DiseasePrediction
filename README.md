# Heart Disease Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Heart Disease Prediction System** using machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on medical attributes.

This project is completed under the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**.


## 🎯 Objective
To predict:
- **0 → No Heart Disease**
- **1 → Heart Disease Present**

---

## 🏥 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle / UCI Heart Disease Repository**.

### Key Features:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- ECG results
- Maximum heart rate
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression
- Slope, vessels, and thalassemia

Target column:
- `target`
